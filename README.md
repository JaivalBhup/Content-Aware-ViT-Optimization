# Content-Aware-ViT-Optimization
This project compares the performance of different Vision Transformer (ViT) variants, including the Vanilla ViT, Seam Carved ViT, Superpixel Segmented (SS) ViT, and Adaptive Dimension (AD) ViT. The primary goal is to assess how various image resizing and content-aware techniques impact classification performance and computational efficiency.
